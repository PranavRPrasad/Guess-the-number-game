# Guess-the-number-game
This is just a program which tells you whether the number which u've guessed is right or wrong. Also it gives clues each time a guess is made. The numbers are randomly generated by a python built in function.
I've assumed the range of numbers from 1 to 1 lakh and also assumed the maximum number of guesses to be equal to 15
