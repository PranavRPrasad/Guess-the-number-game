# Guess-the-number-game
This is just a program which tells you whether the number which uve guessed is right or wrong. Also it gives clues each time a guess is made. The number is randomly generated by a python built in function
Ive assumed the range of numbers from 1 to 1 lakh and also assumed the maximum number of guesses to be equal to 15
